"""Use a weighed random process to grow a three note motive.
The outcome is guided by a series of user-specified constraints.

In this case, we take the notes C, D, E and try to grow a 16 beat
phrase in C major using by repeatedly applying transpositions and inversions
to a motive.

The solver does not employ back-tracking, so it may well reach a dead-end
and need to be restarted a few times before a solution is reached.
