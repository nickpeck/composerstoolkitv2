""" This is used to grade chords of a given size (cardinality) by intervalic tension in a post-tonal context
using personal criteria.
- min 2nds are classed as 'sharp dissonances'
- major 2nds are classed as mild 'dissonances'
- maj and min 3rds are soft consonances (I rate min 3rds slightly dissonant)
- tritone is generally considered a dissonance
4ths and must be determined based upon context - if a min 2nd is present, it is more open, but more restless
otherwise.
Given that we are using the Forte sets as input, this doesn't really take timbre, register or spacing into account.
Typically, the sharp/mild dissonances tend to become somewhat milder when inverted and spread > greater than an
octave.
