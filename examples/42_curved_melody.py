"""
In this example, we try to generate a melodic figure that curves upwards using increasingly faster note values.
Rather than random generation, we use 90 degs of a sine wave as our guide.
The transformers consult the guide for each value, and then choose the nearest pitch, and nearest rhythm from the available
domain of pitches and rhythms (in this case, notes of C major, and durations 1-12)
