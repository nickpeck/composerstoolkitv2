"""This introduces 'dyanamic' properties that allow us to delegate previously fixed args
of transformers to a function that is computed at runtime. This makes it easy
to create transformers that change/shape a musical sequence over time.

In this example, we generate a stream of random notes and pass it through a transformer
that forces the notes into a given octave space that rises upwards every 60 beats.
