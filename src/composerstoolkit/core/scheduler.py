class Scheduler(Thread):
    """
    Maintains a single thread for scheduling playback of sound events across multiple channels.
    It can be run in two evaluation modes:
     - ahead of time (default) - the next note for each channel is calculated and enqeued on the
     main thread. This means that the scheduler is soley responsible for playback.
     - just in time (jit=True), this is used where transformers are being used that rely upon the
     realtime context (ie active pitches), and requires musical events to be evaluted on the playback thread.
     The scheduler will try to compensate for latency, but might result in glitches if the tempo/density is too rapid.
    Usage:
        The evaluation thread (sequencer) should call Scheduler.enqueue(channel_no, seq) for each seq.
        the schedular object is an iterator, which yields (channel_no, seq, offset) each time we are
        ready to evaluate the next item for each channel
